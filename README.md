# Project Title : RomaniaEthnicMap, Population Management and Visualization Tool

## Description:
This JavaFX application serves as a population management and visualization tool for Romanian counties. It allows users to interactively explore and update demographic data, providing insights into the ethnic makeup of different regions.

## How to Use:
1. Setup:
* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Ensure you have Java 21 and Maven installed.

2. Database Configuration:
* Set up a PostgreSQL database with the provided schema.
* Update the JDBC connection details in the code.

3. Build and Run:
* Build the project using Maven: mvn clean install.
* Run the application: mvn javafx:run.

4. Interact with the Map:
* Click on the map to select a county and view its demographic data.
* Update population information using the UI elements.

5. Reset Database:
* Use the "Reset" button to revert the database to its initial values.
